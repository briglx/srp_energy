# srp_energy

_Update this is now part of Home Assistant Core https://github.com/home-assistant/core/releases/tag/2020.12.1_

_Due to [ADR0004](https://github.com/home-assistant/architecture/blob/master/adr/0004-webscraping.md) this integration was removed from [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/tree/0.99.0) with version 0.100, and are now republished here._

⚠️ This integration scrapes a website to get the information!
⚠️ There are no one actively maintaining this repository.

The `srp_energy` integration shows information from Srp hourly energy usage report for their customers. The srpenergy module fetches the data found on the website.

You need a Username, Password, and AccountId which you can create at [Srp](https://www.srpnet.com).

## Installation

1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
2. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
3. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `srp_energy`.
4. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/srp_energy/` directory (folder) in this repository.
5. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
6. Restart Home Assistant.
7. Move on to the configuration.

Using your HA configuration directory (folder) as a starting point you should now also have this:

```text
custom_components/srp_energy/__init__.py
custom_components/srp_energy/manifest.json
custom_components/srp_energy/sensor.py
```

## Example configuration.yaml

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: srp_energy
    username: YOUR_USERNAME
    password: YOUR_PASSWORD
    id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID
```
